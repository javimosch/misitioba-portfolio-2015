		h2.title Why
		div
			p
				|In the actuality you can found web apps that solve the posibility of organize food events with a price where there is a host who 'sell' his home-made recipes and guests who pay one price for all the event. What if you just want to share you recipe and taste another one and the same time and/or just meet people without any kind of money exchange. Easy, thats exactly why meetfood should be born.

			p.
				Meetfood consist in one web application in which the user sign-in and can start creating or joining existing events. The event configuration is the master peace of the app allowing the user to establish event rules from the number of invitations availables to rules such as 'only vegan food' or 'women meetup'. There will be a lot of rules and options divided in 'food and people' covering all aspects of the meeting. All this optional configuration will make the app pretty flexible and useful to solve any organizational subject.
