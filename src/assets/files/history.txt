Gracias Flore,

Just to have seen your reply today made my day.
A bit more about me then,
I'm grow up in country side of Mar del Plata, a city in the west cost of province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. I finish my technical studies specializing in software because I was an 'old school gamer' back then, who was dreaming to become a game developer when I grow up. Almost six years ago I did a 360 flip without an skate and freeze my IT studies to visit Europe because I was fan of the old continent and I realized I wanted to experience living there some day. I move back to Buenos Aires to become independent and started working in a small software factory while I was living in a share flat. For a couple years I just worked for enjoy the day with friends and travel, with no direction. After four years in  BsAs I lived with more than twenty foreign flatmates and I hosted more than thirty travelers from all over the world. All this plus the countries I went through, help me to understand better the world and different cultures. Even if I had the experience of working in videogames years ago, I did it with passion, but after the 360 flip my goals had changed. The share flat experience give me a new perspective about what food and socials means, and after listen to so many people histories I tried to comprend how I can fit in the world, but to achieve things while helping people. Becoming an startupper was and is my long-term project.
I'm always asking my self and to others, 'what if'. What if there is and app to do such a thing. Ideas come and go, I do not have time to write them all or I am not aware at the time. Sometimes people are listening and remember, and sometimes I'm alone and the ideas flow with the wind. I always lacked execution, time and support to concretize this kind of things. Experience told me that I just a piece of gear looking to fit in a ideal site. I am happy with this and I think that is as it should be.

Right now is 2016 and I moved to Paris for a while to awaken the senses. Not being in your confort zone always is a way to improve in every aspect. In the meanwhile I'm rolling around here and my personal projects involve keeping evolving as an autodidact, collecting new skills and to connect with people (beyond the meaning 'connect' of linkedin) to make ideas to happen.

About how I picture myself within comuneat or any young startup. Being part of daily decisions and having own voice. Delivering all my effort for a purpose, the essence of the idea or for group of people really looking forward for something to happen. Sharing all my knowledge and willing to listen and learn from every word from others.


How we can follow ? I don't know, but there is a few questions that I wonder right now.

When did comuneat born, why and how. Briefly.
How about your working team. How is conformed?.
What kind of problems are you dealing right now to keep expanding your idea?.
Do you expect to incorporate new people at your team now or in the future ?.

If I being annoying or just too informal don't hesitate and tell me.

Saludos!,
